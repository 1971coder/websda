# Landscape Scan: Feasibility & SDA Calculators (Australia & Global)

**Purpose**: identify existing calculators and software your app may emulate, integrate with, or differentiate from.

---
## A. SDA–specific calculators & references

1) **NDIA – SDA price calculator & pricing arrangements**
   - What it does: calculates expected annual SDA income by dwelling type, design category, location and occupancy.
   - Notes: official reference for SDA price limits and MRRC (Maximum Reasonable Rent Contribution). Good anchor for your revenue models.
   - Useful terms to mirror: design categories (HPS, Robust, FA, IL), building types, location factors, MRRC.
   - URL: https://www.ndis.gov.au/providers/housing-and-living-supports-and-services/specialist-disability-accommodation/sda-pricing-and-payments

2) **NDIA announcement – SDA calculator updated (2023+)**
   - Highlights: clarifies that calculator covers MRRC and shared living arrangements.
   - URL: https://www.ndis.gov.au/news/9656-sda-calculator-updated

3) **Consumer Affairs Victoria – RRC breakdown for SDA (tenant contribution)**
   - Rule of thumb: RRC is capped at 25% of the basic DSP (+ 25% of pension supplement where applicable) **plus** 100% CRA.
   - URL: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/specialist-disability-accommodation/for-residents/paying-rent-in-sda-residents

4) **Housing Hub – “How rent works in SDA” (plain-English explainer)**
   - Simple framing: max rent ≈ 25% of DSP + 100% CRA (practical explainer for participants).

## D. Gaps & takeaways for **SDA Modeler**

- None of the generic feasibility tools natively model **SDA‑specific income rules** (NDIA price tables, MRRC/RRC, shared living rules, RRC indexation), nor **resident‑level** data with DSP/CRA nuances.
- Opportunity: combine **development cashflow + SDA revenue engine + tenancy/RRC** with configurable rules and time‑based cashflows (draws and income ramps).
- Prioritise: versioned assumptions (DSP/CRA rates, SDA price guide editions), scenario save/compare, and a transparent audit trail for financiers.
